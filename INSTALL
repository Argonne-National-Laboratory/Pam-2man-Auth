About
=====
The Pam 2man Authentication plugin was coded as a laboratory experiment after
the Snowden leaks to evaluate the effectiveness and feasability of implementing
a 2 person rule for computer systems.  Its target application space is 
*nix applications that use PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) for 
authentication.  For full details see the included README file.

This code has not recieved a proper security audit, nor do its authors consider
it to be an adequate solution for a robust security environment.  It was developed
as a proof of concept only.  Long story short: if you don't trust your system admins,
this won't protect you.  However, we will do our best to fix bugs and support anyone
who is using it to the best of our abilities / schedules permitting.

Installation 
============
Requires PAM devel files.  On Debian/Ubuntu derivatives, this is the
libpam0g-dev package.  On Redhat-based distros (CentOS, Fedora, etc), its
pam-devel.

Make install will handle most things, including putting libraries in the right places
and creating an "acl" for the sudo_authorizers group.  More on that in a minute.

To build and install:

$ make
$ sudo make install

By default anyone in the system group called "sudo_authorizers" will be able
to approve calls to sudo.  This plugin does not change the authorization 
rules for sudo, only requires that user B approve user A's actions.  If user 
A does not have permissions to execute the action he/she is attempting 
(according to /etc/sudoers), user Bs approval will not grant that.

User B does not need the same /etc/sudoers permission to approve User A's 
actions, he only needs to be part of the sudo_authorizers group (or whichever
group is specified in /etc/2man/acl/sudo.acl).

Configuring sudo for 2man auth
==============================

CentOS/RHEL/Fedora users... if you implement any custom functionality in 
/etc/pam.d/system-auth-ac, this will be bypassed after make install.  If 
you're not sure what this means, it probably doesn't affect you.  If you're 
ultra paranoid, please look at the config in rpm/etc/pam.d/sudo and make any
suggestions you think are missing.

Non-Redhat derived distros must add:
auth required pam_2man.so group

to /etc/pam.d/sudo 

(should work the same for any other pam capable service)

Uninstall
=========
sudo make uninstall will do its best to clean up everything it installed.  It
will not touch any user's groups, etc that were created for actual use, nor
will it remove the requirement for pam_2man.so if you've added it to /etc/pam.d
make sure you remove it or you will lose sudo access (and have to use su and/or
root to fix).
